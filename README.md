# Diabetes Health Assessment

## Analysis of Apple Health Data 

In this notebook, I explore my Apple health data in order to understand how well I am managing my diabetes.

I will focus on three main data frames, which will include insulin data, blood glucose data and data about my energy intake and expenditure (kcal burned, consumed, and the macronutrients in my diet).

After preprocessing the data (1), correcting for outliers (2), and adding new features to the dataframe (3), I will merge the data frames into one unique that the frame from which I will produce the visualisations (4) about my weekly average values for blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, energy balance, and the split of macronutrients.
